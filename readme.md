# LeoneLabs GlowGlyphs
Glow Glyphs are chainable LED letters and symbols made from PCBs. They can be connected together with push-on connectors to create custom LED signs and displays.

I made some custom software tools for quickly placing components and creating custom PCBs so this is the product of those tools.
